\section{Introduction}

\section{\label{sec:model} Model}
An open system of point particles is considered in volume $V\subset\mathbb R^3$ in three space dimensions. The total volume $V$ is partitioned into $N_v$ non-overlapping congruent cubic cells $\Delta_l$, $l\in\{1,...,N_v\}$, each of volume $v$, such that $V$ is the union of all $\Delta_l$'s:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{volume}
	V = \bigcup_{l=1}^{N_v}\Delta_l,\qquad
	\Delta_l \cap \Delta_{l'} = \emptyset, \text{ if } l \neq l',
	\\ \qquad\mbox{and}\quad
	V = v N_v.
\end{eqnarray}
The interaction energy between particles in configuration $\gamma_N = \{{\vb r}_1, ..., {\vb r}_N\}$, where ${\vb r}_i$ is the space coordinate of the $i$-th particle and $N$ is the number of particles in the configuration $\gamma_N$, is defined as follows
\begin{equation*}
	W_{N_v}(\gamma_N) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{{\vb r}_i,{\vb r}_j \in \gamma} \Phi_{N_v} ({\vb r}_i, {\vb r}_j)
\end{equation*}
where $\Phi_{N_v}$ is given by the Curie-Weiss interaction
% The two-particle interaction energy is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:curie-weiss-pot}
	\Phi_{N_v}(\vb{r}_i, \vb{r}_j) = -\frac{J_1}{N_v} + J_2\sum_{l=1}^{N_v} \mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l}(\vb{r}_i) \mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l}(\vb{r}_j).
\end{equation}
The first term in $\Phi_{N_v}$ describes a global Curie-Weiss (mean-field-like) attraction for any pair of particles in the system.
The strength of this attraction is controlled by an energy parameter $J_1 > 0$. The second term in $\Phi_{N_v}$ describes a local repulsion between two particles contained within the same cell $\Delta_l$ and is characterized by the parameter $J_2 > 0.$
Here, $\mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l}(\vb{r})$ is the indicator function of a cell $\Delta_l$,
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:I}
	\mathbb{I}_{\Delta_l} (\vb{r}) = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1, \quad \vb{r} \in \Delta_l,
		\\
		0, \quad \vb{r} \notin \Delta_l.
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
We refer the reader to Refs.~\cite{KKD18,KKD20,RDKPS25arxiv} for a more rigorous definition of the model. The main features of the model are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the model possesses an exact solution in the thermodynamic limit;
	
	\item for sufficiently low temperatures, the model exhibits an infinite sequence of first-order phase transitions between fluid phases of successively increasing density;
	
	\item the phase transition lines between each pair of neighboring phases terminate at respective critical points, and therefore an infinite number of critical points exist in the model.
	
\end{itemize}
The phase diagrams in both the temperature-density and pressure-temperature planes are presented in~\cite{KD22}.

Let us briefly introduce notation to be used in this paper, and then summarize the known results for the model.

The grand partition function is expressed as follows
\begin{equation*}
	\Xi = \sum_{N=0}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta^N}{N!} \int_{V} \dotsc \int_{V} \exp(-\beta W_{N_v}(\gamma_N)) {\rm d} {\vb r}_1 \dotsc {\rm d} {\vb r}_N
\end{equation*}
where $\zeta$ is the activity
\begin{equation*}
	\zeta = \frac{\exp(\beta \mu)}{\Lambda^3},
\end{equation*}
$\beta = k_{\rm B} T$ the inverse temperature, $k_{\rm B}$ the Boltzmann constant, $T$ the temperature, $\mu$ the chemical potential, $\Lambda = (2\pi\beta\hbar^2/m)^{1/2}$ the de Broglie thermal wavelength, $\hbar$ the Planck constant, $m$ the mass of a particle. In the grand partition function the integration goes over all configurations with $N$ particles and then the summation goes over all positive integer values of $N$.

We use the following standard dimensionless variables: the reduced temperature $T^*=k_{\mathrm{B}}T/J_1$, the reduced pressure $P^* = P v/J_1$, the reduced chemical potential $\mu^* = \mu/J_1$, the reduced particle density $\rho^* = \frac{\langle N \rangle}{V} v = \frac{\langle N \rangle}{N_v}$, with $P$ being the pressure, and $\langle N \rangle$ the average number of particles in the system, where the brackets denote a grand-canonical ensemble average. The particle density $\rho = \frac{\langle N \rangle}{V}$ is also used throughout the paper.

For stability of interaction the following condition must hold
$J_2 > J_1.$
For this reason we introduce notation
$a = J_2/J_1.$ and set $a=1.2$ in the current work.

The exact asymptotic expressions for the grand partition function were obtained in~\cite{KKD18,KKD20}. Here, we present the result in the form presented in~\cite{RDKPS25arxiv}:
\begin{equation}
	\Xi \simeq c_{N_v} \exp[N_v E(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})]
\end{equation}
which is asymptotically exact for the limit of $N_v \to \infty$. Here $\bar{y}_{\rm max}$ is a function of both $T^*$ and $\mu^*$ and is found from the condition of maximum for quantity $E$, which is defined as follows
\begin{equation*}
	E(T^*, \mu^*; y) = -\frac{y^2}{2}T^* + \ln K_0(T^*,\mu^*; y),
\end{equation*}
where $K_0(T^*,\mu^*; y)$ is the $0$-th member of the following family of special functions
\begin{eqnarray}\label{def:Kj}
	K_j(T^*,\mu^*;y) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n^j \left(v^* T^{*3/2} \right)^n}{n!} \exp[\left(y+\frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*}n^2]
\end{eqnarray}
for $j=0,1,2,\ldots$, where $v^* = v/\lambda^3$, $\lambda = (2\pi\hbar^2/mJ_1)^{1/2}$. Quantity $c_{N_v}$ does not play any role in the thermodynamic limit, therefore we do not provide its explicit expression here.

For detailed investigation of the conditions necessary for the global maximum of $E$ and the derivation of relations for $\bar{y}_{\rm max}$, we direct the interested readers to works~\cite{KKD18,KKD20,KD22,RDKPS25arxiv}. In this paper, we employ the methodology developed and the results derived in those works to study structure properties of the model, in particular one- and two-particle densities, and the pair distribution function.


\section{\label{sec:init-pair-distribution} Pair distribution function}
The $n$-particle distribution function is defined via the $n$-particle densities as follows (for reference, see Section~2.6 in~\cite{HansenMcDonald13})
\begin{equation*}
	\label{def:g_n}
	g^{(n)}({\vb r}_1, \dotsc, {\vb r}_n)=\frac{\rho^{(n)}({\vb r}_1, \dotsc, {\vb r}_n)}{\prod_{i=1}^{n}\rho^{(1)}({\vb r}_i)}
\end{equation*}
where the $n$-particle density defined in the grand canonical ensemble is
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\label{def:rho_n}
	\rho^{(n)}({\vb r}_1, \dotsc ,{\vb r}_n) = \frac{1}{\Xi}\sum_{N=n}^{\infty} \frac{\zeta^N}{(N-n)!} \int\exp(-\beta W_{N_v}(\gamma_N)) {\rm d} {\vb r}_{n+1} \dotsc {\rm d} {\vb r}_N.
\end{eqnarray*}
In this work, our goal is to calculate the pair distribution function $g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$
\begin{equation*}
	g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \frac{\rho^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)}{\rho^{(1)}({\vb r}_1) \rho^{(1)}({\vb r}_2)}.
\end{equation*}
Therefore, we first need to calculate the one- and two-particle densities.

\subsection{One-particle density}

Let us first calculate $\rho^{(1)}$. By definition
\begin{equation}
	\label{def:rho1}
	\rho^{(1)} ({\vb r}_1) = \Xi^{-1} \sum_{N=1}^{\infty} \frac{\zeta^N}{(N-1)!} \int \exp(-\beta W_{N_v}({\vb r}_1, \dotsc, {\vb r}_N)) {\rm d} {\vb r}_2 \dotsc {\rm d} {\vb r}_N.
\end{equation}
Applying the method described in~\cite{KKD20}, we obtain the following result
\begin{equation*}
	\rho^{(1)} ({\vb r}_1) = \frac{K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{v K_0(T^*,\mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})} = \frac{\rho^*(T^*,\mu^*)}{v}
\end{equation*}
where we used the following equality~\cite[Eq.~(42)]{RDKPS25arxiv}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rho_in_y}
	\rho^* = \frac{K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{K_0(T^*,\mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}.
\end{equation}
Therefore, for the considered cell fluid model with Curie-Weiss interaction we obtained the result known for homogeneous systems: the single-particle density is equal to the average particle density, see~\cite[Eq.~(2.6.5)]{HansenMcDonald13}:
\begin{equation}
	\rho^{(1)}({\vb r}_1) = \rho.
\end{equation}

In the present theory, the average value of the cell-occupation number $n$ can be calculated using the probability measure $Q_{T^*,\mu^*}(n)$~\cite{KKD20}:
\begin{equation*}
	Q_{T^*,\mu^*}(n) = \frac{1}{K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) n!} \left(v^* T^{*3/2}\right)^n \exp\left[\left(\bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*} \right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*}n^2 \right],
	\quad n \in \mathbb{N}_0,
\end{equation*}
so that
\begin{equation*}
	\langle n \rangle_{Q} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n Q_{T^*, \mu^*}(n),
\end{equation*}
where $\langle (\ldots) \rangle_Q$ denotes averaging with respect to the probability measure $Q_{T^*, \mu^*}(n)$.
Hence, we can write the following equalities:
\begin{equation}
	v \rho^{(1)}({\vb r}_1) = \langle n \rangle_{Q} = \rho^*.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Two-particle density}

Let us now calculate the two-particle density, defined as
\begin{equation*}
	\rho^{(2)} ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \Xi^{-1} \sum_{N=2}^{\infty} \frac{\zeta^N}{(N-2)!} \int \exp(-\beta W_{N_v}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2, \dotsc, {\vb r}_N)) {\rm d} {\vb r}_3 \dotsc {\rm d} {\vb r}_N.
\end{equation*}
To deal with this expression, we again follow the methodology developed in~\cite{KKD20}. However, it is important to note that the result for $\rho^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ varies depending on whether ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to the same cell or to different cells.

When ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to different cells, the result for $\rho^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ is as follows
\begin{eqnarray}
	\rho^{(2)} ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) & = & \left[\frac{K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{v K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}\right]^2
	\nonumber \\
	& = & \frac{\rho^{*2}}{v^2} = \frac{\langle n \rangle_{Q}^2}{v^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
From this expression the result for $g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ follows immediately
\begin{equation}
	\label{g2_diff}
	g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = 1, \quad \text{if } \nexists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l),
\end{equation}
that is, when ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to different cells.

When ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to the same cell, the result for $\rho^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ is as follows
\footnote{compare with Eq.~(2.6.4) from~\cite{HansenMcDonald13}}
\begin{equation}
	\rho^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \frac{1}{v^2} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n(n-1) Q_{T^*, \mu^*}(n) 
	= \frac{\langle n(n-1) \rangle_{Q}}{v^2}.
\end{equation}
and for $g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ one gets
\begin{equation}
	\label{g2_same}
	g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \frac{\langle n(n-1) \rangle_{Q}}{\langle n \rangle_{Q}^2}, \quad \text{if } \exists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l),
\end{equation}
that is, when both ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to the same cell $\Delta_l$. Based on Eqs.~\eqref{g2_diff} and~\eqref{g2_same}, the general expression for $g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ takes on the form
\begin{equation}
	g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) =  \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1, & \text{if } \nexists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l),
		\\
		\frac{\langle n(n-1) \rangle_{Q}}{\langle n \rangle_{Q}^2}, & \text{if } \exists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l).
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation} 

In what follows, we will mostly focus on $g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)$ with ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ in the same cell.
First thing to note is that given ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to the same cell, the two-particle density does not otherwise depend on the position of the particles, thus we can just write $\rho^{(2)}$ for simplicity. The same consequently applies to $g^{(2)}$.

Before proceeding with numerical and graphical results for the pair distribution function $g^{(2)}$ let us rewrite it in a few alternative representations.

If expressed in terms of $K_j$, quantities $\rho^{(2)}$ and $g^{(2)}$ take on the following forms
\begin{eqnarray}
	\rho^{(2)} = \frac{K_2(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) - K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})},
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}
	g^{(2)} & = & \frac{\left[K_2(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) - K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})\right] K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})^2},
\end{eqnarray}
respectively. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_aux} for details.

We can also represent the results for the pair distribution function in the form of parametric equations. Applying the idea taken from~\cite{KD22}, we introduce a new function
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:change_y_to_z}
	\bar{z}_{\rm max} = \bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*},
\end{equation}
and express the chemical potential as a function of two variables $(T^*, \bar{z}_{\rm max})$
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:mu_in_z}
	\mu^* = T^* \bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}} - \frac{\tilde{K}_1(T^*;\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}})}{\tilde{K}_0(T^*;\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}})},
\end{equation}
where the special functions $\tilde{K}_j$ are written as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\tilde{K}_j(T^*;\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}}) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n^j (v^* T^{*3/2})^n}{n!} 
	%\nonumber\\
	%\times 
	\exp[\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}}n - \frac{a}{2T^*}n^2].
\end{eqnarray}
Now, the two-particle density and the pair distribution function take on the following forms
\begin{equation}
	\rho^{(2)} = \frac{\tilde{K}_2(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max}) - \tilde{K}_1(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max})}{v^2 \tilde{K}_0(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max})},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:g2_in_z}
	g^{(2)} = \frac{\left[\tilde{K}_2(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max}) - \tilde{K}_1(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max})\right] K_0(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max})}{\tilde{K}_1(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max})^2}.
\end{equation}
At any given temperature $T^*$, Eqs.~\eqref{eq:g2_in_z} and~\eqref{eq:mu_in_z} can be formally considered as a parametric equation for the pair distribution function $g^{(2)}$ as a function of $\mu^*$, with $\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}}$ being the parameter.

Similarly, if Eq.~\eqref{eq:rho_in_y} is rewritten as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:rho_in_z}
	\rho^*(T^*;\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}}) = \frac{\tilde{K}_1(T^*;\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}})}{\tilde{K}_0(T^*;\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}})},
\end{equation}
then Eqs.~\eqref{eq:g2_in_z} and~\eqref{eq:rho_in_z} constitute a parametric equation for the pair distribution function $g^{(2)}$ as a function of $\rho^*$, at any given $T^*$ and with $\bar{z}_{\mathrm{max}}$ being the parameter.

\end{figure}

At this point, we are in a position to illustrate the obtained results for the pair distribution function graphically. In Figure~\ref{fig:g2_z} the pair distribution function is shown as a function of $\bar{z}$ for two different values of temperature: $T^*=0.32$, which is above the range of critical temperatures, and $T^*=0.20$, which is below the range of critical temperatures. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:g2_y} the pair distribution function is shown as a function of $\bar{y}$ for the same temperatures.

In Figure~\ref{fig:g2_rho} the pair distribution function is shown as a function of density $\rho$ for the same temperatures.

Very interesting behavior of $g^{(2)}$ is observed in Figure~\ref{fig:g2_rho_low_temp}, where the dependency on density is presented in the low temperature limit, namely for $T^*=0.1$ 

The dependence of the pair distribution function on the chemical potential $\beta\mu$ is shown in Firugre~\ref{fig:g2_mu}.

The spatial dependency of $g^{(2)}(x_1, x_2)$ for the cell model with Curie-Weiss interaction can be presented as a step function. While $x_1$ and $x_2$ are located within one cell, $g^{(2)}$ takes on a value that is dependent of the temperature and chemical potential (or of density). However as soon as the coordinates of two particles belong to different cells, $g^{(2)}$ becomes unity.
In Figure~\ref{fig:g2_r} such step dependency is illustrated for different values of temperature and density. The temperature and density are selected to correspond to Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and to a supercritical region over ``Phase I - Phase II'' the critical point. Since the value for Phase I is hardly visible in the scale of the graphic, Figure~\ref{fig:g2_r_low_dens} shows $g^{(2)}$ in Phase I in a better scale, along with the low-density limit~\eqref{eq:g2_low_limit}.

\section{Auxiliary calculations}
\label{sec:appendix_aux}

When ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to the same cell, the two-particle density is expressed in terms of functions $K_j$ defined in~\eqref{def:Kj} as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\rho^{(2)} & = & \frac{1}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})} \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1) \frac{\left(v^* T^{*3/2}\right)^n}{n!} \exp\left[\left(\bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*} n^2\right]
	\\
	& = & \frac{1}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n^2 - n) \frac{\left(v^* T^{*3/2}\right)^n}{n!} \exp\left[\left(\bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*} n^2\right]
	\\
	& = & \frac{K_2(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) - K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, for $g^{(2)}$ one obtains
\begin{eqnarray}
	g^{(2)} & = & \frac{\left[K_2(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) - K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})\right] K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})^2}
\end{eqnarray}


\section{\label{sec:low-dens}Low-density limit of the pair distribution function}
For an isotropic system the pair distribution function $g^{(2)}(\vb{r}_1, \vb{r}_2)$ is a function only of a separation $r \equiv \abs{\vb{r}_1 - \vb{r}_2}$, and the low-density limit is equal to the Boltzmann factor $e(r)$ of a pair interaction potential $v(r)$, see e.g. Section~2.6 in~\cite{HansenMcDonald13}:
\begin{equation*}
	\lim_{\rho \to 0} g^{(2)}(r) = e(r) \equiv \exp(-\beta v(r)).
\end{equation*}
Let us assume that in the case of the cell model studied in this paper, the following comes true as well
\begin{equation}
	\lim_{\rho \to 0} g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = e({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)
\end{equation}
where the Boltzmann factor for the Curie-Weiss interaction defined in~\eqref{def:curie-weiss-pot} is
\begin{equation*}
	e({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \exp\left[-\beta \Phi_{N_v}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2)\right].
\end{equation*}
If ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ are in different cells, then
\begin{equation*}
	e({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \exp(\frac{\beta J_1}{N_v}) = \exp(\frac{\beta^*}{N_v}).
\end{equation*}
In the limit of $N_v \to \infty$
\begin{equation*}
	e({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) \approx 1 + \frac{\beta^*}{N_v} \approx 1.
\end{equation*}
If ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ are in the same cell, then
\begin{equation*}
	e({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \exp(\frac{\beta J_1}{N_v} - \beta J_2) = \exp(\frac{\beta^*}{N_v} - \beta^* a). 
\end{equation*}
In the limit of $N_v \to \infty$,
\begin{equation*}
	e({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) \approx \exp(-\beta^* a).
\end{equation*}
Therefore, 
\begin{equation*}
	\lim_{\rho \to 0} g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\exp[\frac{\beta^*}{N_v} - \beta^* a], \quad & \text{if } \exists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l),
		\\
		\exp[\frac{\beta^*}{N_v}], \quad & \text{if } \nexists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l).
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation*}
which in the thermodynamic limit $N_v \to \infty$ becomes
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:g2_low_limit}
	\lim_{\substack{\rho \to 0 \\ N_v \to \infty}} g^{(2)}({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2) = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		\exp[- \beta^* a], \quad & \text{if } \exists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l),
		\\
		1, \quad & \text{if } \nexists \Delta_l ({\vb r}_1, {\vb r}_2 \in \Delta_l).
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
