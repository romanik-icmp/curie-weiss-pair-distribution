\section{Auxiliary calculations}

When ${\vb r}_1$ and ${\vb r}_2$ belong to the same cell, the two-particle density is expressed in terms of functions $K_j$ defined in~\eqref{def:Kj} as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\rho^{(2)} & = & \frac{1}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})} \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n(n-1) \frac{\left(v^* T^{*3/2}\right)^n}{n!} \exp\left[\left(\bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*} n^2\right]
	\\
	& = & \frac{1}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n^2 - n) \frac{\left(v^* T^{*3/2}\right)^n}{n!} \exp\left[\left(\bar{y}_{\rm max} + \frac{\mu^*}{T^*}\right)n - \frac{a}{2T^*} n^2\right]
	\\
	& = & \frac{K_2(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) - K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{v^2 K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Therefore, for $g^{(2)}$ one obtains
\begin{eqnarray}
	g^{(2)} & = & \frac{\left[K_2(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max}) - K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})\right] K_0(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})}{K_1(T^*, \mu^*; \bar{y}_{\rm max})^2}
\end{eqnarray}

If we perform some transformations, we can express quantity $K_1$ via $K_0$
\begin{eqnarray*}
	\tilde{K}_0(T^*; \bar{z}_{\rm max}) \langle n \rangle_Q & = & 
	v^{-1} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n \frac{\left(v^* T^{*3/2}\right)^n}{n!} \exp(\bar{z}_{\rm max}n - \frac{a}{2T^*}n^2)
	\\
	& = & \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{v^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \exp(\bar{z}n - \frac{ap}{2}n^2)
	\\
	& = & \left| n=m+1; \quad \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \rightarrow \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}; \quad n^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 \right|
	\\
	& = & \exp(\bar{z} - \frac{ap}{2}) \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{v^n}{n!} \exp\left[(\bar{z} - ap)n - \frac{ap}{2}n^2 \right]
	\\
	& = & \exp(\bar{z} - \frac{ap}{2}) \langle \exp(-apn) \rangle_Q
	\\
	& = & \exp(\bar{z} - \frac{ap}{2}) K_0 (\bar{z} - ap, p),
\end{eqnarray*}
and thus
\begin{equation*}
	\langle n \rangle_Q = \frac{K_0(\bar{z} - ap, p)}{K_0(\bar{z}, p)} \exp(\bar{z} - \frac{ap}{2})
\end{equation*}
